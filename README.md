DevOps Configuration Management Kata
====================================
> An exercise in which we'll be provisioning a LAMP stack with Vagrant & Ansible.

Description
-----------
Choose any technology stack and toolset that you want to use. We've seen folks
do the entire presentation on their laptop, and we've seen folks use cloud-based
infrastructure. It's all good as long as it represents your thoughts and your
process.

The point of these exercises is to show how you think and how you
approach the problems. We are not looking for a specific answer so much as
problem-solving skills and an awareness with regards to how these activities
might be implemented in the "real world".

Please keep some kind of versioned history and plan to make that available to
the interviewers. Commit often enough that someone could understand the path you
took to your solution. You won't be asked to walk through the commit history,
this is just for us to look at later.

When you have completed the project you will be asked to give a 20 minute
presentation on your completed project and then will pair with current
Pillarites to expand upon your project.

Requirements
------------
- [x] Install/configure the CM tool of your choice.
- [x] Automate the provisioning of a 3-tier web application stack (data layer,
      application layer, presentation layer). An example stack might be, but is
      in no way limited to, redis/passenger/nginx.
- [x] Automate the deployment of a simple 'ping' page that establishes that each
      of the 3 layers in the stack are available.
